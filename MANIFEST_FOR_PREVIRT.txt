The proposed new manifest for previrtualization:

* modules  [list of paths to bc]  [no longer use libs]

* main  single path to main bc [used to be called module]

* binary  name for binary

* libs   (bc)  [DEPRECATED]

* name  (the expected value of argv[0])

* native libs [either paths to .o .a .so or flags like -lm -lc -lpthread]

* ldflags [linker flags like '--static' '--nostdlib' as well as '-L..' flags to indicate where the native libs are]

* search  [DEPRECATED  use -L...  in ldflags if you MUST ]

* shared  [DEPRECATED]

* arguments [list of specialized args to main ]

* watch [ an examples would be nice: runtime monotoring; probably needs to be moved into a separate beast. ]
        [ watch was useless; watch2 was functional circa 4 years ago. ]
	
So for example: musl_nweb would look like:



{ "main"        :  "nweb.o.bc"
, "binary"      : "nweb_occam"
, "modules"     : ["libc.a.bc"]
, "native_libs" : ["./crt1.o", "./libc.a"]           
, "ldflags"     : [ "--static", "-nostdlib" ] 
, "args"        : ["8181", "${ROOT}"]
, "name"        : "nweb"                # note that this is argv[0] and args describes argv[1:]
}


while yices would look like


{ "main"        : "yices_smt2.bc"
, "binary"      : "yices_smt2_previrt"
, "modules"     : ["libpoly.so.bc"]
, "native-libs" : ["-lgmp"]
, "ldflags"     : ["-L/usr/lib", "-L/usr/local/lib", "-L/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/"]
, "name"        : "yices_smt2"
}


or

{ "main"        :  "yices_smt2.bc"
, "binary"      : "yices_smt2_gmp"
, "modules"     : ["libpoly.so.bc", "libgmp.so.bc"]
, "native-libs" : []
, "ldflags"     : []
, "name"        : "yices_smt2_gmp"
}

or

{ "main"        : "yices_smt2.bc"
, "binary"      : "yices_smt2_gmp_c"
, "modules"     : ["libpoly.so.bc", "libgmp.so.bc", "libc.a.bc"]
, "native-libs" : ["crt1.o", "libc.a"]
, "ldflags"     : [ "--static", "-nostdlib" ]
, "name"        : "yices_smt2_gmp"
}


note that bc paths are either absolute or relative to the current working directory.
whereas native libs are either absolute or relative to the current working directory
or in the search path indicated by the ldflags.
