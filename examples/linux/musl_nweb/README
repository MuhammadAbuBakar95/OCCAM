Specialization of nweb with initial program arguments using the 'nweb.manifest'.

The 'build.sh' script builds the nweb binary.

This binary serves files out of the subdirectory 'root'.

To test the non occamed result:

	./nweb_static 8181 ./root &

and connect with

	curl localhost:8181

To test the occamed result:

	./nweb_occam 8181 ./root &

and connect with

	curl localhost:8181



======

need a flag to indicate static vs dynamic linking.


ldflags:  linker flags

libs:   could either be a flag (i.e. -lsomething or else a path or a file)


search could possibly be absorbed by ldflags


------

Bruno:

* modules  (bc)  [no longer use libs]

* module  (bc)

* libs   (bc)  [DEPRECATED]

* native libs

* ldflags 

* search  [DEPRECATED  use -L...  in ldflags if you MUST ]
