Specialization of nweb with initial program arguments using the 'nweb.manifest'.

The 'build.sh' script builds the nweb binary which serves files out of the subdirectory 'root'.

To test the result, run

	./nweb

and connect with

	wget localhost:8181


nweb-base needs to be called like so:

	 ./nweb-base 8181 ./root
